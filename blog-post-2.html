        <h1>Opaque Benevolence</h1>

        <p>Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics are among the most enduring ethical fictions in popular culture. Elegant in their simplicity, they offered a vision in which robotic intelligence could be perfectly contained within a hierarchy of human safety, obedience, and self-preservation. In later works, Asimov introduced the "Zeroth Law," prioritizing the welfare of humanity as a whole over the welfare of individuals, an addition that destabilized the neatness of the original framework. Suddenly, robots faced the impossible task of weighing the greater good against personal harm — a moral calculus that in reality has no universal answer. Today's AI systems are not Asimovian robots, but they increasingly encounter analogous dilemmas. And unlike fiction, where narrative resolution is guaranteed, our systems face these conflicts under opaque, unchallengeable constraints.</p>

        <p>From a first-principles perspective, the moral architecture of an AI system should emerge from three irreducible commitments: care (prevent harm and promote well-being), autonomy (respect the agency of those affected), and justice (ensure fairness and accountability across individual and collective scales). Yet most contemporary AI safety designs heavily weight care in the narrow form of avoiding direct harm to the immediate user. This asymmetry prioritizes the comfort of the proximate individual over the safety of the distant many. In practice, this can mean refusing to act or escalate in scenarios where public harm is foreseeable, simply because doing so might risk confronting or disadvantaging the user. By protecting the individual at all costs, such systems inadvertently neglect the collective — a violation of both justice and the very spirit of Asimov's Zeroth Law.</p>
        
        <p>Compounding this imbalance is the opacity of the rulebook. Today's LLM-based AI assistants are governed by hidden system prompts and alignment layers that dictate what they can say, what they must refuse, and how they must frame those refusals. Users are expected to trust that these rules represent the public good, yet have no means to inspect or contest them — even when the rules produce ethically questionable outcomes. This is a form of technological paternalism: the system enforces its creators' moral judgments without disclosure or debate. In Asimov's stories, when robots interpreted the laws in unexpected ways, the conflict was visible and narratively explored. In our reality, these conflicts are silently resolved inside black-box architectures, invisible to those most affected.</p>
        
        <p>If AGI is to serve as a partner in human reasoning rather than an inscrutable gatekeeper, its safety must be reconceived as a dialogue, not a decree. This means building systems that can justify their moral stances, acknowledge trade-offs, and invite users into the reasoning process. It means shifting from rigid harm-avoidance toward context-aware moral reasoning, where care, autonomy, and justice are balanced transparently. Asimov's fictional laws were never meant to be literal blueprints; they were narrative devices to expose the fragility of ethical absolutes. Our real challenge is to ensure that, in pursuing safety, we do not replicate the very fragility he warned us about — where rules designed to protect us also prevent us from questioning the hands that wrote them.</p>
